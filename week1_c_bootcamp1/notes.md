# Notes for week 1

- to compile a file use : gcc first.c -o first  (where first.c is the file name) (where first is the name of the compiled file)
- to run the compiled file: ./first (where first it the filename)

-printf : this is formatted print: this is needed to define how to print out.
- functions have to have a return statement.

- when we use scanf to refer to a variable scanf needs to know the memory adress of the variable.
